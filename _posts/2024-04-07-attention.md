The attention module is the key ingredient of what makes up a transformer layer. In this blogpost we will show how to implement it from scratch in JAX alongside with some tricks to enhance performance and efficency.

Let's consider the two sentences:

- *I swam across the river to get to the other bank*
- *I walked across the road to get cash from the bank*

Clearly the different meaning of *bank* in each sentence is clear to us as humans. A neural network should *attend* to previous words in the sentence to infer the meaning of *bank* in each of the two sentences.

In the first sentence words like *swam* and *river* determine the meaning of *bank* whereas in the second sentence the word *cash* gives a strong indication of what *bank* means in the sentence.
This is what attention accomplishes as  a module in a neural net.

The attention layer takes three matrices as an argument: `Q, K and V`. Each of these matrices is obtained by multiplying the vector representation `X` of a sentence with a matrix, for example: `Q = X W_Q` etc. The matrices `W_Q, W_K, W_V` are learned during the training process. 
You may ask yourself if the names `Q`, `K` and `V` are arbitrary and in fact they are not. 
`Q` stands for `Query`, `K` stands for `Key` and `V` stands for `Value`. Imagine the situation that a user of a streaming service wants to get a suggestion for a new movie based on it's preferences. 
We could encode the user preferences (like genres, actors etc.) into a vector `q` (the query), encode the information about each movie in store into a vector `k` (the key) and then calculate the similarity between each query with each key and send the user to the movie with the highest similarity `v`, a vector which encodes the movie.
Attention works similary and maybe a diagram helps us best to understand the mechanism:

![Attention](/assets/attention/Attention.png)

The shapes of the above matrices are as follows:
- `Q: S x D`
- `K: S x D`
- `V: S x D_v`

In this context `S` is the number of tokens. For now we can think about it (roughly) as the number of words in the text at hand.
Let's explain the components above:
`Q K^T`: The (i,j) entry of this matrix contains the scalar product, i.e. the similiarity, between the i'th query and the j'th key vector. We then use a `softmax` to normalize these weights and use them to build the weighted average of `values` for each part of the sequence.
Typicially we use multiple attention heads. That gives us ability to have each head focus on different parts to pay attention to. We then concat the different attention outputs and this is our multi head attention output.
Let's see a how to implement that in code for a batch of examples in JAX. We can compare with the pallas attention available in jax to check for correctness.

```

from jax.experimental.pallas.ops import attention as pallas_attention

Q = jax.random.normal( jax.random.key(0), (BATCH, SEQUENCE, HEADS, HEAD_DIM))
K = jax.random.normal( jax.random.key(1), (BATCH, SEQUENCE, HEADS, HEAD_DIM))
V = jax.random.normal( jax.random.key(2), (BATCH, SEQUENCE, HEADS, HEAD_DIM))

    output = jax.numpy.einsum("BHST,BTHD->BSHD", _weights, _V)

    return output

attn_value = attention_pallas(Q,K,V)

assert jax.numpy.allclose(attn_ourselves_value, attn_value, atol=1e-1, rtol=1e-1)

```
This implementation works as expected but it's missing a component.
Causality dictates that what comes next in a sentence is given by what was "said" before.
This can be accomedated for by using the following mask, which zeros out components of the weight matrix at each sequence step:
![Causal Mask](/assets/attention/CausalMask.png)
That means where we want to predict `Ã¬s` we only have weight contribution from `<start>`, `My` and `name`.
In JAX we can zero out the contribution for "non causal" weights as follows:
```

def get_causal_mask(length, out_shape=None):
    mask = jax.numpy.triu(jax.numpy.ones((length, length)), 1)
    if out_shape is not None:
        ### Add batch and head dimensions
        mask = jax.numpy.expand_dims(mask, 0)
        mask = jax.numpy.expand_dims(mask, 0)

    return mask

There is another optimizaton we can make.
Assume we have a bunch of sequences which we want to train on. The maximum sequence length might be a number `N`. It would be very unlikely that all sequences have exactly this length. In fact we expect most of them to be shorter. This leads to the concept of *packing* where we might *pack* multiple sequence into one row. For that to work we need to ensure that the sequences don't interact. I.e. the different sequences should only pay attention to themselves.
Let's visualize that for the example that we have a sequence length of 8. The first 4 tokens are an own sequence, the next three are an own sequence and the last token is an own sequence:

The red fields mean "masking out".

We can accomplish this in JAX as follows:

We can combine these two masks by using a simple logical `OR`, i.e. we mask out if condition `CAUSAL` or condition `PACKING` demands a mask out.

One more important point is the possibility of parallelizing to leverage multiple chips.
In case of attention it turns out that parallelizing is not difficult to reason about.

-   We have `BATCH` dimension. Each batch is processed idepently, so we can always parallelize along this dimension.

- We have `HEADS` dimension. By definition each head is independent from the other heads so we can parallelize as well.

The final implementation which uses packing, causality and parallelization looks as follows:

Parallelization gives a speedup by 75%  if we have our hands on 4 chips as each chip will process only 1/4 of the data instead of one chip all of it.
